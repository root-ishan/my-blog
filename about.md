Hi, I’m **Ishan Sawhney**, a Network Engineer specializing in Routing & Switching. I work as an Escalation Engineer at Juniper Networks and I'm fortunate to have the opportunity to work with the most pressing issues and the latest technologies in the world of Networking
I've worked on a lot of networking, product and implementation issues in my tenure as a networking engineer and love to share my learnings with other curious minds so that together we can come up with solutions

This blog is where I share:
- Lessons learned in the field
- Troubleshooting case studies
- Protocol deep dives

I’ll often include:
- **Command outputs** in code blocks
- **Network diagrams** (drawn using Mermaid.js or embedded images)
- **Configuration snippets** for clarity with syntax highlighting for Vendor Specific configs.
